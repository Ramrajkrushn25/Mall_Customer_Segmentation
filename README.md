# Mall_Customer_Segmentation


## Overview
This project focuses on **Customer Segmentation** for a mall using machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze customer data and group them into segments based on their spending patterns and other demographic details. These insights can help businesses tailor their marketing strategies effectively.

## Features
The dataset includes the following features:
- **Sex**: Gender of the customer (Male/Female).
- **Age**: Age of the customer (in years).
- **Annual Income**: Customer's yearly income (in thousands of dollars, 'k$').
- **Spending Score**: A score assigned by the mall, ranging from 1 to 100, based on customer spending behavior.

## Objective
The primary objective is to group customers into distinct segments using clustering algorithms. These segments can represent different customer personas based on their behavior and preferences.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Exploration**: 
   - Understanding the dataset and visualizing the relationships between features.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Droping unwanted columns ( Customer_ID)
3. **Clustering**:
   - Applying clustering algorithms like K-Means
   - Determining the optimal number of clusters using methods like the Elbow Method.
4. **Visualization**:
   - Visualizing clusters in 2D and 3D spaces to interpret the results.
5. **Insights**:
   - Interpreting the clusters to identify customer groups and their characteristics.

## Results
### Cluster Visualizations
- **2D & 3D Clustering**:
  - **Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score**: A comprehensive view of customer segmentation based on these three dimensions.

These visualizations provide actionable insights into customer personas, such as:
- High-income, high-spending customers.
- Younger, low-income yet high-spending customers.
- Middle-aged, moderate-income and moderate-spending customers.
